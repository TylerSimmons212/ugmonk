        <h1>About Ugmonk</h1>
        <h2>What is Ugmonk?</h2>
        <p>We are a brand focused on creating quality, well-designed products that we wanted ourselves. Read our origin story here.</p>
        <h2>How do you pronounce Ugmonk?</h2>
        <p>One word: “ugg-munk”</p>
        <h2>Where did the name come from?</h2>
        <p>While the actual origin of the word remains a secret, we chose the name because it was simple enough to remember and weird enough to stand out. When we chose the name “Ugmonk” it had no connotations or associations which allowed us to define it to what it is today.</p>
        <h2>Where are you located?</h2>
        <p>We are located in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, USA (near Philadelphia)</p>
        <h2>Do you have retail stores?</h2>
        <p>No. We mostly sell directly through our online shop. This allows us to keep our overhead costs down and keep our prices affordable. The beauty of selling online is that we can reach millions of people around the globe and and focus on what we do best, designing new products.</p>
        <h1>Orders</h1>
        <h2>What forms of payment do you accept?</h2>
        <p>We accept major credit cards such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover or directly payment through PayPal.</p>
        <h2>Do you sell Gift Cards?</h2>
        <p>Yes, we certainly do. You can purchase Ugmonk Gift Cards here. The gift cards are delivered by email and contain instructions to redeem them at checkout. Our gift cards have no additional processing fees and no expiration dates.</p>
        <h1>Shipping</h1>
        <h2>Where do you ship to?</h2>
        <p>We ship to almost every country in the world.</p>
        <h2>What does shipping cost?</h2>
        <p>Just add the items to your cart and select your country from the list to get a shipping price.</p>
        <h2>How long does shipping take? What shipping methods do you use?</h2>
        <p>All orders are shipped via USPS. Please allow 2-4 business days for orders to be processed after your purchase is complete.
            Domestic Shipping (within the USA)
            Standard Shipping (USPS First Class and Priority): 5-10 business days
            Express Shipping (USPS Express Mail): 2-3 business days
            International Shipping (varies per country)
            First Class International: 3-5 weeks (customs processing times vary)

        </p>
        <h2>I live outside of the USA, will I be charged additional customs fees or import taxes?</h2>
        <p>Most likely. Every country has different regulations on how they handle imported goods. We recommended you visit this Duty Calculator to get an estimate of what you will be charged when the package arrives. We do not pre-pay or cover any import fees.</p>
        <h2>Can I track my order?</h2>
        <p>Once your order has been shipped, you will receive an email with a USPS tracking link. Please allow 24hrs for the link to activate. Once the packages leaves the US, the tracking links may not update but the package is still on its way.</p>

        <h1>Products</h1>
        <h1>Clothing</h1>
        <h2>How does your clothing fit?</h2>
        <p>Please refer our Size & Fit page for details about each of our products.</p>
        <h2>I ordered two shirts of the same size, why is one smaller?</h2>
        <p>Some of the designs are printed on different style shirts. Check the product description for any special sizing notes or refer to our Size & Fit page here.</p>
        <h2>How should I care for my tees, crewnecks, and hoodies? Will they shrink?</h2>
        <p>We recommend turning them inside out and machine or hand washing on cold. Since all of the shirts have some percentage of cotton, they will tend to shrink a little after being washed and dried. To minimize the shrinking, machine dry low or hang dry.</p>
        <h2>What type of printing process is used on your clothing?</h2>
        <p>All of our shirts and hoodies are screenprinted. Most of the shirts are printed with water-based or discharge ink which leaves an extremely soft print. A few of the shirts use a soft-hand plastisol ink to get a bright white print. Check the product pages for the specific type of printing for each individual product.</p>
        <h2>Will the printing on the tees fade?</h2>
        <p>We use high quality water-based inks to produce the softest printing possible. Some of the printing may fade a little after multiple washes.</p>
        <h2>Do you manufacture your products in-house?</h2>
        <p>While we do all of our design in-house, we don’t do our own manufacturing. We partner with great manufacturers all across the US for each of our products.</p>
        <h2>Can you notify me when a product is back in stock?</h2>
        <p>Yes. If a product is out of stock, simple click the “Notify me when Available” button on the product page and enter your email address. You can also subscribe to the Ugmonk Newsletter, follow me on Twitter.</p>
        <h1>Messenger Bags</h1>
        <h2>What size laptop fits in the bag?</h2>
        <p>This bag can accommodate laptops up to 15” without a case or 13″ with a case. Of course smaller laptops and tablets will comfortably fit in the rear compartment as well.</p>
        <h2>The leather seems stiff at first, will it soften up?</h2>
        <p>We use full-grain premium 6-7 oz. leather sourced right here in the USA. It may seem a bit stiff at first but will quickly soften with some use and wear. The beautiful aspect of the leather is that it will conform to your individual use and get better with age.</p>
        <h2>Where is the messenger bag made?</h2>
        <p>Each bag is handcrafted in Portland, Oregon and all of the fabrics, leather, and hardware are sourced from the USA to ensure the highest quality possible.</p>
        <h2>How should I care for the bag?</h2>
        <p>Waxed cotton canvas is a rugged water-resistant material and can be used for years without washing. Waxed canvas should not be machine washed as the detergent and washing will deteriorate the fabric. To spot clean dirty areas, simply use a damp cloth and let air dry.</p>
        <h2>Is the bag waterproof?</h2>
        <p>The combination of the exterior waxed canvas and interior Cordura nylon lining make the bag very water resistant but the bag is not 100% waterproof. Your gear should stay dry even if you get caught in the rain, but we recommend keeping the bag in a dry place when possible.</p>
        <h1>Leather Goods</h1>
        <h2>What type of leather do you use?</h2>
        <p>The premium full-grain English Bridle leather sourced from Wickett & Craig, one of the leading tanneries in the world that’s been producing leather for over 120 years. This leather is soft to the touch yet super durable and will develop a beautiful patina over time with use and wear.</p>
        <h2>The cards are a little hard to take in and out of the wallet, will it stretch out?</h2>
        <p>Yes, the card slots are designed to fit the exact size of a credit card so they may seem tight at first. Over time the leather will stretch out with use and the cards will be much easier to get in and out of the wallet.</p>
        <h2>My leather mousepad is warping, what should I do?</h2>
        <p>Since leather is a natural material, it can tend to warp a little bit. To get the mousepad to lay flat, simply work the leather with your hands bending it the opposite direction that it is curling. The more it is handled the more pliable it becomes.</p>
        <h2>How can I prevent my leather mousepad from slipping on my desk?</h2>
        <p>If your desk is made from a slippery material like glass, your mousepad may move around a little bit. To prevent this, you can adhere a small piece of double-sided tape or purchase small rubber feet like these.</p>
        <h2>What should I do to care for my leather products?</h2>
        <p>Leather will absorb the oils from your hands and may not need any maintenance. If the leather seems to be drying out, you can condition it with mink oil or neatsfoot oil. Apply a light coat of oil and work it into the leather using your hands or a dry cloth. Allow leather to dry before using.</p>
        <h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
        <h2>I want to sell Ugmonk products in my shop. Do you sell wholesale?</h2>
        <p>We primarily sell directly to our customers through our website, but we also sell through a few select boutiques which we screen on a case by case basis. We want to make sure that Ugmonk is a good fit for the companies we work with and that our products are represented well. If you would like more information, please contact us with information about your shop.</p>
        <h2>I love the design of your website. Where did you get your template?</h2>
        <p>Thanks, we’re glad you like it. We designed our site from scratch and spent hundreds of hours (and cups of coffee) building it. We put a lot of thought and time into creating a unique experience to communicate what our brand is all about. Please do not copy or use any parts of our site as your own.</p>
        <h2>What platform does your website run on?</h2>
        <p>The Ugmonk website runs on a combination of 2 platforms. The shop is powered by Shopify. The rest of the site runs on an installation of WordPress hosted by Fused Network. The seamless integration between the two platforms is more intense than a couple snippets of code or some magic plugin, so we recommend hiring an experienced web developer if you’re looking to do the same.</p>
        <h2>What other services and apps do you use to run Ugmonk?</h2>
        <p>Check out the full list of tools we use on the Resource Page</p>
        <h2>Can I hire you to do custom design or development work for my or my company?</h2>
        <p>Sorry, we don’t do any outside design work. Ugmonk keeps us so busy that we don’t have time to take on any other projects.</p>
        <h2>I’d like to design for Ugmonk, do you hire outside designers?</h2>
        <p>Sorry, we don’t accept any outside design submissions. We are control freaks and like to keep all of the product design for Ugmonk in-house. All of our designs are Ugmonk originals, created by Ugmonk’s founder Jeff Sheldon.</p>
